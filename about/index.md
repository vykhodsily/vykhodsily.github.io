### About

“Vykhod Sily” (or “The Way The Force Is Coming Through” in English) is a podcast launched by Rustee (Special Request Crew) back in 2013 to push 85/170 BPM things further as being heavily influenced by Autonomic movement and things related. In the course of time the podcast has become probably one & only in Russia focusing on halftempo. The musical agenda represented in the podcast has been constantly reinforced both with the various subgenres of modern 170 BPM electronica and with an oldschool influence. Aired every Thursday at <span id="podcast-airtime"20:00 (UTC+3)</span> on the DROPTHEBASS radio.
