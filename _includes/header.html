    <p>“Vykhod Sily” (or “The Force Output” in English) is a podcast launched by Rustee (Special Request Crew) back in
        2013 to push 85/170 BPM things further as being heavily influenced by Autonomic movement and things related. In
        the course of time the podcast has become probably one & only in Russia focusing on halftempo. The
        musical agenda represented in the podcast has been constantly reinforced both with the various subgenres of
        modern 170 BPM electronica and with an oldschool influence. The podcast is on air regularly on Thursdays on

        <a target="_blank" href="http://mixlr.com/special-request/">Mixlr</a> (+mic) at 10PM (UTC+5).</p>
